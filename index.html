        <h2>What's wiþ all ðe weird letters?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm glad you asked! eth (Ð/ð) and thorn (Þ/þ) were formerly characters in the english
            alphabet. The letters fell out of use with the introductin of the gutenburg printing
            press. Since the first presses and typesets were sourced from Germany there were no eth
            and thorn characters available. This led to the letters being replaced with 'y' and
            eventually 'th'. This is why 'ye olde' is a thing! 'The' was originally spelled with a
            thorn, which got replaced with the letter y before the two letter combination 'th' was
            settled on.
        </p>

        <p>
            'Why are you using both eth and thorn?' I hear you ask. Well that's a great
            question too! eth and thorn were both used in olde english interchangeably for both
            the voiced and voiceless dental fricative. Eventually the use of eth fell out of favor
            and only thorn remained. I think we should revive both characters! and use them for
            their proper pronounciation this time. That's why I use eth for voiced dental
            fricatives and thorn for the voiceless counterpart.
        </p>

        <p>
            Confused? Don't worry. At first I was too. An easy trick to figure out which to use is
            to first replace 'th' with either 'f' or 'd'. If the word sounds more correct with 'f'
            then you should use thorn (example: think -> fink -> þink). If the word sounds more
            correct with 'd' then use eth (example: this -> dis -> ðis). See? Easy!
        </p>

            (Note this section was written without my normal use of eth and thorn for clarity of reading)
